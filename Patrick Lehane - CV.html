            Playing Old School RuneScape, it revolves around mastering its tick system. With each tick lasting 0.6 seconds, the gameÂ´s dynamics are built on precise timing. Every action, from combat strategies to resource gathering, aligns within these ticks. Efficient play uniquely hinges on understanding and leveraging this fundamental timing aspect for optimal gameplay.
